# Arduino Decoder
Arduino code to recieve data in the packeted format used by the eChook board.

This code was needed for the [motoChook](https://github.com/rjpgriffin/motochook) adaption of the eChook where a secondary microcontroller takes the data and logs it to an SD card and shows it on a 3" OLED display. It might be useful for anyone wanting to expand on the capabilities of the eChook board.
